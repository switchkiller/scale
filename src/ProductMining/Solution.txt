High Level Architecture:

Pre sale:

Company needs to update products available from warehouse and stock for sale.


Main :

1. Sale begins
2. Every user is a thread. Every thread makes a purchase if and only if product is in stock.
3. So for sale to interact with user, we will design a class which is making sale on behalf of multiple users.



Do abstract class have a constructor? -> Yes

When using parameterized constructor always declare the access level. Constructors never have a return type i.e they are not void and so on. Always take care of these things.
TODO:
1. Check the flow for Sales, Sale and Product class. We update product from Sales Department, and Sale is able to get it..
